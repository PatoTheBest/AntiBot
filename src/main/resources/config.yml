# Condition System - (Protection Mode)
#
# PPS -> Pings/second (IPs that pinged the server in the last second)
# CPS -> Connections/second (IPs that are connecting but got cancelled in the last second)
# JPS -> Joins/second (IPs that passed the checks and joined in the last second)
#
# This example means "The server needs any PPS, 4 CPS and 1 JPS to activate the module".
# conditions:
#   PPS: 0
#   CPS: 4
#   JPS: 1
#
# When the conditions are achieved the module will start blocking bots.
# If not, the module wont check anyone. (Made to only work while attack)
# Setting all conditions to 0 will keep the module always active.
